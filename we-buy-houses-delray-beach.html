            <p>How do house buying companies purchase so quickly? If you are looking to sell your home fast for cash, that you could sell to a cash buyer agency like we buy houses or an ibuyer.  You’ll customarily get an offer within 24 hours, and you may close in less than two weeks (generally).  But there’s a catch: these house buying businesses don’t pay top dollar for houses.  Offers from ibuyers like offerpad and opendoor are aggressive (from time to time just 1–2% below open market offers), but they’re accessible only in select major metros.  Offers from “we buy houses” businesses are always low (as little as 50% of the house’s resale value).  Take a hybrid strategy using a home trade-in service.  Generally, the most direct path to a fast home sale is through an ibuyer or agency that buys houses for cash.  Cash buyer companies , which are also occasionally called house flippers, acquire homes in pretty much any situation and can often close in under two weeks.  But in addition they pay the least amount of money — occasionally as little as 50% of the home's after repair (or resale) value.  Some cash home buyers will make an offer without seeing your private home first.  Don’t be surprised when these other home-buying agencies hit you with hidden fees. </p>
